Function declarations that appear inside of normal blocks typically hoist to the enclosing scope, 
rather than being conditional as this code implies:
However, it's important to note that this behavior is not reliable and is subject to change in future versions of JavaScript,
so it's probably best to avoid declaring functions in blocks.
