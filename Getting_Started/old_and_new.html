                Pollyfilling
                ES6 defines a utility called Number.isNaN(..) to provide an accurate non-buggy check for NaN values, deprecating the original isNaN(..) utility. 
                But it's easy to polyfill that utility so that you can start using it in your code regardless of whether the end user is in an ES6 browser or not.
                The if statement guards against applying the polyfill definition in ES6 browsers where it will already exist. If it's not already present, we define Number.isNaN(..).

                Here's a quick example of transpiling. ES6 adds a feature called "default parameter values." It looks like this:
                Simple, right? Helpful, too! But it's new syntax that's invalid in pre-ES6 engines. So what will a transpiler do with that code to make it run in older environments?
